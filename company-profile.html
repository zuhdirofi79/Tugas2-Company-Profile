            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <img src="assets\our story.png" alt="Our Story">
            <p>Based on The Washington Post; Doctoral student Jacob George, left, and professor Greg Clark examine the LUKE Arm, a motorized and sensorized prosthetic that has been in development for over 15 years. (Dan Hixson/University of Utah College of Engineering)</p>
            <p>The brain then “translates” these into characteristics such as firmness, texture and temperature, all of which are crucial in deciding how to interact with the object, he said. In other words, by using the LUKE Arm (named after the “Star Wars” hero Luke Skywalker, and manufactured by Deka), Walgamott, of West Valley City, Utah, was able to “feel” the fragility of a mechanical egg, just as he would have with a natural limb. He could pick it up and transfer it without damaging it.

              As he performed everyday activities with the prosthetic — such as holding his wife’s hand, sending a text message and plucking grapes from a bunch — Walgamott told researchers that it felt like he had his arm back. Even his phantom pain was reduced.
              
              “When the prosthetic hand starts to feel like the user’s real hand, the brain is tricked into thinking that it actually is real,” Clark said. “Hence, the phantom limb doesn’t have a place to live in the brain anymore. So it goes away — and with it, goes the phantom pain.”</p>

              <h3>Arm Prosthetic Support</h3>
              <p>The critical component of a prosthetic powered by thought would be the communication between the brain and a robotic body part — called the brain-computer interface (BCI). F-Arm uses a neural interface, but in other mind-controlled prosthetics, brain implants are used to send instructions to a robotic limb, much like how neurons transmit messages from the brain to a muscle. But this means precision brain surgery and all the attendant risks, not to mention the expense and recovery time.</p>

              <h3>Leg Prosthetic Support</h3>
              <p>Robotic leg prostheses promise to improve the mobility and quality of life of millions of individuals with lower-limb amputations by imitating the biomechanics of the missing biological leg. Unfortunately, existing powered prostheses are much heavier and bigger and have shorter battery life than conventional passive prostheses, severely limiting their clinical viability and utility in the daily life of amputees. Here, we present a robotic leg prosthesis that replicates the key biomechanical functions of the biological knee, ankle, and toe in the sagittal plane while matching the weight, size, and battery life of conventional microprocessor-controlled prostheses. The powered knee joint uses a unique torque-sensitive mechanism combining the benefits of elastic actuators with that of variable transmissions. A single actuator powers the ankle and toe joints through a compliant, underactuated mechanism.</p>

            <h3>Eye Prosthetic Support</h3>
            <p>We presented Robotic prosthetic eye prototype models. The first model uses an external infrared sensor array mounted on a frame of a pair of eyeglasses to detect natural eye movement and to feed the control system to drive the artificial eye to move with the natural eye. The second model uses human brain EOG (electrooculography) signals picked up by electrodes placed on both sides of a person's head to carry out the same eye movement detection and control tasks as mentioned above. Theoretical issues on sensor failure detection and recovery, and signal processing techniques used in sensor data fusion are studied using statistical methods and artificial neural network based techniques. In addition, practical control system design and implementation using micro controllers are studied and implemented to carry out the natural eye movement detection and artificial robotic eye control tasks.</p>
